# How I verified this — full log

_Harness-captured record for task `99fa5ba5`, commit `88cf94ba994ae423070eada8bbcc992a29bd8f63` — not model-authored: no_human wrote this file from the command receipts a PostToolUse observer recorded. It records what the gate produced; it is not a verdict of the model that wrote the code._

## How I verified this
5 commands recorded - as recorded (shortened, folded onto one line), grouped by kind. **No entry asserts a pass or a fail:** read the output. Not necessarily everything the session ran.

### test
- `uv run pytest -q tests/test_structural_budget.py 2>&1 | tail -100`

**Not verified:** everything below is a limit of this section, listed whether or not it bit this attempt.

- no command recognised as e2e, http, typecheck, lint, build was recorded
- an entry shows that a command LINE was submitted to the shell and what came back - never that the check recognised inside it RAN, and never that it was the RIGHT command: `pytest -k test_nothing` prints a clean run, and a recorded command line may name a check the shell never reached yet is still counted - TEN SHAPES WERE DRIVEN against bash 3.2.57 with the check replaced by a marker-printing stub and the marker was absent in every one: a failed `&&`, a taken `||`, an `exit`, an `exec`, an `exit` inside a `source`d script, a syntax error that aborts the REST of the line, a multi-line `if false`, a `case` that matches nothing, `set -e` aborting an earlier command, and `set -u` on an unset variable; that list is MEASURED, NOT EXHAUSTIVE, because this module is not bash, so a kind this section does NOT list as missing is a kind some recorded line named, which is not the same as a kind that ran
- the text is the coder's: the session chose the command string and, through `echo`/`printf`, can choose the output too. Both are shown as inert text, and no entry ASSERTS a pass, a fail, or an exit status - `pytest -q | tail -3` exits with `tail`'s status, `Error: Exit code 1` is a line IN THE OUTPUT, and where the harness reported a timeout or an interruption instead of output that report is appended to the captured text in square brackets. Read the output
- recognition reads the command line ONLY - it never looks inside what a command runs, so `bash -c 'uv run pytest -q'` leaves no receipt at all while `make test` leaves one that names `make` and not the recipe it ran; and the other way, a check merely NAMED in a heredoc body, or in a quoted string that happens to spell a shell separator, can be recorded as though it ran
- commands run inside a spawned subagent are deliberately excluded, so delegated work leaves no receipt here; a command the harness refused to run (blocked, or permission denied) leaves none, because it never ran; and only a command the HARNESS backgrounded leaves no receipt at all - it hands back a task id instead of output. A trailing `&` YOU wrote is NOT that and is NOT excluded: `pytest -q &` is recorded and headed `test`, and may still have been running when the harness returned
- the COMMAND and the output are both redacted and bounded before they are stored - an excerpt is not the full log, a credential-shaped string may have been masked out of either, a command over 400 characters is shortened in the middle, each command is displayed on ONE line with its newlines folded to spaces (so it may not re-run as written), and invisible and direction-changing characters are stripped before display; look-alike letters are NOT detected
- nothing here checks that these commands exercise the diff - no receipt is compared against the files this PR changes; no interactive UI check was performed (no_human never drives a browser at your change except testing/ui_evidence.py's walk, reported as its own evidence, not a receipt; the only other page it drives is a CI server's login form, and the board it opens without driving, so an `e2e` entry is the project's harness printing its result, not a human-style walkthrough); and no_human's own test run, CI, and the independent review are separate signals - this section covers only the coder session's own commands
- at most 200 receipts are recorded per attempt; past that the observer stops recording, and this section says so above when the limit was reached

See the PR body's **Evidence** table for the orchestrator's own test run.
